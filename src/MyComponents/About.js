                    Hello everyone, I hope you're having a great day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an engineer by day and a gamer by night. I am working in Persistent Systems as a Software Engineer and playing as a Jett in Valorant. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I always had fun creating things, which is my main motive behind pursuing engineering as a career.  I love learning new technologies and always looking for new ways to do stuff. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides work, I have participated in multiple hackathons to up my googling skills. I have been part of the team that won the Smart India Hackathon Grand Finale - 2020.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Gaming is my passion. Whenever I am not coding on my laptop with music in my headphones, I am playing my heart out on games like valorant, f1, assassin's creed. I am also an immense fan of movies and tv shows.
